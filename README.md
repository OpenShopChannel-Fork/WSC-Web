# WSC-Web
This could potentially be a server for the Open Shop Channel.

## Needs
- support for downloading
- improved look
- testers!
- 

## Wants
- themes, like "classic", "default", "dark", etc
- nice touches like the 8-bit mario

## What is this fork?
I want to develop this repo so that it at least gets a bit better in terms of the look and feel. I know nothing about support for downloading and I cannot test as I dont know how to patch a wad.
